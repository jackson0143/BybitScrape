# BybitScrape

Web scraper for the copy trade of a given portfolio, and sends to dedicated telegram channel/bot.
Uses Selenium, and although web scraping is not as effective as using APIs, it is just a test to see how web scraping is done. Additionally, portfolio information is not accessible through the APIs

Coming soon: Bybit trading bot using some indicators, includes backtesting
